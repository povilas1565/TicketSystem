# TicketSystem

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

# Goal of this project:

1. To be able to upload a list of tickets sold and be easily able to mark that payment has been received or not
  Here are the compulsory excel columns:
  - Name: contains the user's name
  - NumberOfTickets : contains a number 0 to 100
  - AmountPaid: a number
  - HasPaid : contains yes or no
  - DatePaid: any value 
2. During the event, we want to be able to easily say when a ticket has been used to check in. Maybe we need checkmarks for each ticket a user has and when someone says they got the ticket from that person, we check it off as used

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
